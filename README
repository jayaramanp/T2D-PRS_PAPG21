These summary statistics describe genome-wide gene-diet interaction analyses for HbA1c conducted in European-ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank. There are 38 files in total, each using a different dietary exposure: 30 are single dietary traits derived from food frequency questionnaires completed at baseline study visit, and 8 are dietary patterns based on PCA of various subsets of these 30 traits.

Columns are as follows:
SNPID: variant ID (chromosome_position_nonEffectAllele_effectAllele)
rsID: variant rsID
CHR: chromosome
POS: position (GRCh37)
Allele1: non-effect allele
Allele2: effect allele
N_Samples: sample size
AF: effect allele frequency
Beta_Marginal: marginal genetic effect estimate (i.e., from a model without an interaction term)
Var_Beta_Marginal: variance of the marginal genetic effect estimate
Beta_Interaction_1: interaction effect estimate
Var_Beta_Interaction_1_1: variance of the interaction effect estimate
P_Value_Marginal: marginal genetic effect p-value
P_Value_Interaction: interaction effect p-value
P_Value_Joint: p-value for the 2-degrees of freedom joint test of genetic marginal and interaction effect
